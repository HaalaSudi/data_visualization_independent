# An investigation into life satisfaction and income in inner London Boroughs from 2011-2017

This was an individual work for my data visualisation module; we were tasked to find datasets to clean and visualise in a clear and concise manner

The main question this report wished to answer was ‘does there exist a correlation between life satisfaction and income?’.

To answer this question, we first needed to analyse our data in full context and figure out if any patterns existed before investigating them further. 
The most interesting pattern shown in this report was the case of Kensington and Chelsea. This borough on average earned the highest income yet had one of the lowest rates of life satisfaction. On the opposite spectrum, Newham earned the lowest income but had one of the highest rates of life satisfaction.

While Kensington and Chelsea’s life satisfaction dropped as their income grew, Newham’s life satisfaction only grew with its income and while it dropped after its peak, it was still above average while Kensington and Chelsea’s life satisfaction was below average. It should be noted, however, that this pattern only showed up with these two boroughs. 

It is also worth noting that the most active years of change were around 2015-2016. In low-income boroughs from the years, 2011-2014 their life satisfaction average was much lower than those in higher-income boroughs in the same years. It could also be said that the rate of life satisfaction, overall, was lower in low-income boroughs compared to higher-income boroughs.

In conclusion, there does exist a correlation between life satisfaction and income. The impact of this research identified that an increase in income, in some cases, did not correlate to a higher life satisfaction rate in boroughs with existing high incomes while in low-income boroughs, an increase in income, on occasion, did correlate to a rise in life satisfaction rates.
